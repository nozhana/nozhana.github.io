      description:
        "Knowledge graphs form large networks of millions of entities (e.g., Michelle Obama, Barack Obama) and relationships (e.g., married). To obtain an overview of the entity, we need to inspect a potentially large number of relationships to other entities. For this reason, entity summarization aims to extract succinct but expressive descriptions of each entity. Yet, existing methods build their summaries only based on the immediate connections of an entity, disregarding how indirect relationships contain essential information for describing the entity (e.g., understanding Michelle Obama also via her husband's role as former president). We propose IRES, an unsupervised entity summarization method built on graph theoretical principles. We draw a notable connection between the informativeness of a summary and graph partitioning, and devise an effective approach to learn diverse aspects that characterize an entity. In a comprehensive experimental study, IRES shows superior summary quality. In particular, when full neighborhood information is available, IRES outperforms existing methods by 6 percentage points F1 while maintaining competitive computational efficiency."

      description:
        "Entity summarization aims to compute concise summaries for entities in knowledge graphs. Existing datasets and benchmarks are often limited to a few hundred entities and discard graph structure in source knowledge graphs. This limitation is particularly pronounced when it comes to ground-truth summaries, where there exist only a few labeled summaries for evaluation and training. We propose WikES, a comprehensive benchmark comprising of entities, their summaries, and their connections. Additionally, WikES features a dataset generator to test entity summarization algorithms in different areas of the knowledge graph. Importantly, our approach combines graph algorithms and NLP models as well as different data sources such that WikES does not require human annotation, rendering the approach cost-effective and generalizable to multiple domains. Finally, WikES is scalable and capable of capturing the complexities of knowledge graphs in terms of topology and semantics. WikES features existing datasets for comparison. Empirical studies of entity summarization methods confirm the usefulness of our benchmark."

        "We study bipartite graph ordering problem, which arises in various domains such as production management, bioinformatics, and job scheduling with precedence constraints. In the bipartite vertex ordering problem, we are given a bipartite graph H=(B,S,E) where each vertex in B has a cost and each vertex in S has a profit. The goal is to find a minimum K together with an ordering < of the vertices of H, so that i<j whenever i∈B is adjacent to j∈S . Moreover, at each sub-order the difference between the costs and profits of the vertices in the sub-order does not exceed K."
